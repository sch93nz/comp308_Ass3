1) List what you have completed:
the textures and the meterial properties, the four lights and i attempted to implement a shader but it didn't go so well also the code that is there is not my code it was more of a so this how you interact with opengl example.

i Got the spot light moving controls as explained bellow and i got the light changing angle plus the cut off changing. but i don't think i made the cone to your specifications again i run out of time.


2) List any additional modifications that are not in the brief:
	1 = turns on/off Light0.
	2 = turns on/off Light1.
	3 = turns on/off Light2.
	4 = turns on/off Light3.
	
	+ expands the spot lights cut off.
	- decrease the spot lights cut off.
	a,w,d,s move the spot light.
	k,o,l,; change the direction of the spot light.
	Esc kills the program.
	
3) How to run your code, if it differs from the original assignment:
 normally everything should be hard coded and i think i took care of the problem with the locations on the ecs machines being different to my windows machine and i have just checked if it compiles on the ecs machines.
